- Microsoft will send an email with a security code for verification. 
   - This part is very crucial since it is part of the last steps of account setup.
- Once you have completed the verification step, you will have access to Microsoft Azure.
   - You  can choose to have a subscription for usage such as Resource Groups, Virtual Machines, etc.
   - Entering in your Debit/Credit information and other credentials will unlock and give you access to a $200 credit balance to use.
    - Remember to remove/delete any background Resource Groups or VM's so your account will not get charged for background activity.
    
<h2> And VIOLA! You now have access to Microsoft Azure!</h2>
- Have fun, use this application to practice and understand any type of virtual ware.
